Let me study all 6 images carefully before responding.Good design foundations overall. Let me give you a complete section-by-section review.

---

## Overall First Impression

Visually clean, dark theme is consistent, typography hierarchy is strong. The yellow/amber accent works well. But there are **structural problems that will hurt conversion** — the page doesn't efficiently answer the one question every landing page visitor has: *"Is this for me, and why should I sign up?"*

---

## Section 1: Hero — "Preparation meets precision"

### ✅ What Works
- Headline typography is bold and impactful
- Two-button CTA (primary + secondary) is correct pattern
- "WHAT YOU GET" stat bar is a great trust signal below the fold

### 🔴 Issue 1: Wrong Exam Mentioned in Stats Bar

```
Current stats:
  1,000+           2018–2024       Free
  TCS Pattern PYQs  Years Covered   Concept Library

"TCS Pattern PYQs" — This is SSC CGL prep, not TCS/IT hiring.
TCS is a software company's campus hiring exam.
SSC CGL students don't care about TCS patterns.

FIX:
  1,000+           2018–2024        Free
  SSC CGL PYQs    Years Covered    Concept Library

OR even more specific to SSC CGL context:
  1,000+           43               Free
  Practice Questions  Topics Covered  To Start
```

### 🔴 Issue 2: Subtitle is Too Abstract

```
Current: "Stop guessing. Start engineering your success.
          Adaptive drills, mental models, and relentless analytics."

Problems:
- "Engineering your success" sounds like generic startup copy
- "Mental models" — SSC CGL students don't know what this means
- "Relentless analytics" — vague

A student from Bihar/UP preparing for SSC CGL reads this and
thinks: "does this actually help me pass the exam?"

FIX — Be specific about SSC CGL:
  "Practice 1,000+ real SSC CGL questions from 2018–2024.
   Track exactly where you're losing marks. Built for serious aspirants."

OR even more direct:
  "The fastest way to improve your SSC CGL Quantitative Aptitude
   and Reasoning scores. Daily practice. Real exam questions. Free."

Specificity beats cleverness every time for exam prep students.
```

### 🟡 Issue 3: Hero Has No Visual/Screenshot

```
Current: Full-width text + two buttons + stat bar
         There is NO visual showing what the product looks like.

Every competitor (Testbook, Adda247) shows the product UI.
A student visiting the landing page can't tell what PrepLeague
looks like inside until they sign up.

FIX: Add a product screenshot or mockup to the right side
of the hero, showing the practice interface or dashboard.

The "Daily practice" section (Image 2) has a nice card mockup —
move something like that into the hero itself.
```

---

## Section 2: "Daily practice. Unstoppable growth."

### ✅ What Works
- "TODAY'S TARGET: 20 Questions · Active" card is excellent
- Progress bars (Quant 8/10, Reasoning 4/10) are concrete and real-feeling
- Green tick mark on "Active" badge looks good

### 🔴 Issue 4: Reasoning Progress Bar is Purple — Inconsistent

```
Current:
  Quant bar:     Green   ████████
  Reasoning bar: Purple  ████░░░░

Purple doesn't match the design system anywhere.
Every other colour in the product is: black, white, amber/yellow, green, red.
Purple appears nowhere else.

FIX: Reasoning bar should be amber/orange to match
the yellow accent colour of PrepLeague:
  Quant:     Green  (already correct)
  Reasoning: Amber/Orange  (match brand colour)
```

### 🟡 Issue 5: "Dynamic daily targets based on your exam date"

```
Current body text: "Dynamic daily targets based on your exam date.
                    1,000+ TCS-pattern questions from 2018-2024."

Again "TCS-pattern" appears. Fix to "SSC CGL pattern".

Also "Dynamic daily targets based on your exam date" is a premium
feature claim — does this actually work? If not, remove it.
Don't promise features that don't exist yet.
```

---

## Section 3: "Speed is a skill. Train it."

### ✅ What Works
- Sprint UI mockup (timer + options) is the best visual on the whole page
- "Option B" highlighted in orange looks authentic
- "00:14s" timer creates urgency feeling
- "Timed sets (10-60 mins)" is clear and concrete

### 🔴 Issue 6: Sprint Mockup Shows Blank Question Lines

```
Current sprint mockup: Shows "SPRINT: ALGEBRA" then
  two grey placeholder lines (blurred text)
  Option A  [blank]
  Option B  [selected, orange]
  Option C  [blank]
  Option D  [blank]

The blurred lines look like a loading state, not intentional design.
It looks like the question failed to render.

FIX: Either show actual question text (even a made-up example):
  "If 2x + 5 = 15, then x = ?"
  A) 3    B) 5    C) 7    D) 10

Or if you want it blurred for mystery, make it look intentionally
blurred/frosted, not like broken placeholder bars.
```

### 🟡 Issue 7: "10-60 mins" Timed Sets — Verify This Is Accurate

```
"Timed sets (10-60 mins)" is listed as a feature.
Current implementation: Sprint is 5-20 questions.
At 30s per question, 20 questions = ~10 minutes.

"10-60 mins" implies up to 60-minute sessions.
If this isn't implemented, don't advertise it.
Change to what's true: "5-20 questions per sprint" or "10-15 min sessions"
```

---

## Section 4: "It finds your weak spots."

### ✅ What Works
- Bar chart visual with "Weak" badge callout is clean
- "FOCUS AREA: Geometry · [Fix This]" bottom card is excellent
- The concept (analytics that surface weaknesses) is your best differentiator

### 🔴 Issue 8: Bar Chart Bars Look Random — No Axis Labels

```
Current: 6-7 grey bars of varying heights + 1 red bar marked "Weak"

Problem: Without axis labels, a visitor can't tell:
- What do the bars represent? Topics? Weeks? Days?
- What does height mean? Score? Attempts?

It looks like a generic decorative chart, not real data.

FIX: Add minimal labels to make it feel real:
  Y-axis: "Accuracy %"
  X-axis: Topic names (short: Geo, Alg, Arith, Ratio...)
  
  OR: Label the tallest bar as "Strong" (green) and
  the shortest as "Weak" (red) — so visitors understand
  the visual immediately without reading anything.
```

### 🟡 Issue 9: Section Has Too Much Empty Space Bottom

```
After "View Dashboard →" there's a large empty white space
before the next section. The section feels unfinished.

FIX: Remove the excess padding or add a subtle
divider/transition between sections.
```

---

## Section 5: "Ready to ascend?"

### 🔴 Issue 10: "Start Free Today" Button Looks Like Secondary Button

```
Current: White/outlined button on black background.
The button looks SECONDARY, not primary.

On your hero, "Get Started Free" is orange/filled = primary CTA.
Here "Start Free Today" is white/outlined = looks secondary.

The final CTA section should have your STRONGEST button style:
  [Get Started Free →]  ← solid orange, same as hero

This is the last chance to convert a visitor. Use your best button.
```

### 🔴 Issue 11: "Join thousands" — You Have 0 Users

```
Current: "Join thousands who upgraded their preparation."

You haven't launched yet. You have 0 real users.
"Thousands" is a false claim.

This will hurt trust when users sign up and see an empty platform.

FIX before launch: Remove the social proof until it's real.
Use something that doesn't require numbers:
  "Be among the first to prepare smarter.
   Free to start. No credit card needed."

After you get real users, update to real numbers.
```

### 🟡 Issue 12: "Cancel anytime" — What Cancels?

```
"Free to start. Cancel anytime."

If the free tier is truly free, there's nothing to cancel.
"Cancel anytime" implies a subscription/payment.

For free users: Just say "Free. No credit card needed."
For the premium CTA: "₹99/month. Cancel anytime."

Don't confuse free users with cancellation language.
```

---

## Section 6: FAQ

### ✅ What Works
- Clean accordion format
- 4 questions is the right number (not overwhelming)

### 🔴 Issue 13: "What exams does PrepLeague cover?" is a Dangerous Question

```
If you answer "SSC CGL only" — that's fine, just be upfront.
If you answer "multiple exams" — are they actually implemented?

A visitor clicking this FAQ and reading "We cover SSC CGL, IBPS,
RRB NTPC..." when you only have SSC CGL content will feel misled.

FIX: Be honest in the answer. SSC CGL focus is actually
a STRENGTH — you're specialized, not generic.
"Currently focused on SSC CGL, with plans to expand."
```

### 🟡 Issue 14: Footer Says "© 2025 PrepLeague"

```
Current: © 2025 PrepLeague
Today's date: Feb 17, 2026

FIX: © 2026 PrepLeague
```

---

## Missing Section — Pricing

```
Your nav has a "Pricing" link but I don't see a pricing
section on the landing page itself.

For a freemium product targeting price-sensitive Indian students,
pricing should be VISIBLE on the landing page — not hidden behind
a separate page. Show it clearly:

┌────────────────┐  ┌────────────────┐
│  Free          │  │  Premium ₹99/mo│
│                │  │                │
│ 20 questions/  │  │ Unlimited       │
│ day            │  │ questions      │
│ 1 sprint/day   │  │ Unlimited sprints│
│ Basic analytics│  │ Deep analytics │
│                │  │                │
│ [Get Started]  │  │ [Upgrade]      │
└────────────────┘  └────────────────┘

Showing ₹99/month explicitly builds trust — students
won't sign up if they're worried about hidden charges.
```

| Fix footer year 2025 → 2026 | 1 min | 🔴 Critical |
| Remove "Join thousands" false claim | 5 min | 🔴 Critical |
| Fix Sprint mockup blank question lines | 30 min | 🟡 High |
