Cookies are in Cakes. The intersection of Chocolates and Cookies ($Ch \\cap Co$) connects to Cakes. Pastries *could* be separate from Cookies/Cakes, but they *could also* overlap. There is no negative statement forbidding Pastries from being Cakes.\n- Thus, \"No pastry is a cake\" is not definitely true. It's a possibility, but not a certainty.\n- Conclusion I does NOT follow.\n\n**Step 3: Check Conclusion II**\n\"Some cakes are chocolates.\"\n- From Statement 2: Some chocolates are cookies.\n- From Statement 3: All cookies are cakes.\n- Therefore, the part of chocolates that are cookies is also part of cakes.\n- So, some chocolates are definitely cakes (and conversely, some cakes are chocolates).\n- Conclusion II FOLLOWS.\n\n**Answer:** Option C (Only conclusion II follows.)",
